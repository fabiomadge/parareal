	Abstract = {Time parallel time integration methods have received renewed interest over the last decade because of the advent of massively parallel computers, which is mainly due to the clock speed limit reached on today's processors. When solving time dependent partial differential equations, the time direction is usually not used for parallelization. But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction offers itself as a further direction for parallelization. The time direction is however special, and for evolution problems there is a causality principle: the solution later in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution earlier in time, but not the other way round. Algorithms trying to use the time direction for parallelization must therefore be special, and take this very different property of the time dimension into account.We show in this chapter how time domain decomposition methods were invented, and give an overview of the existing techniques. Time parallel methods can be classified into four different groups: methods based on multiple shooting, methods based on domain decomposition and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid methods and direct time parallel methods. We show for each of these techniques the main inventions over time by choosing specific publications and explaining the core ideas of the authors. This chapter is for people who want to quickly gain an overview of the exciting and rapidly developing area of research of time parallel methods.},

	Abstract = {R{\'e}sum{\'e}
On propose dans cette Note un sch{\'e}ma permettant de profiter d'une architecture parall{\`e}le pour la discr{\'e}tisation en temps d'une {\'e}quation d'{\'e}volution aux d{\'e}riv{\'e}es partielles. Cette m{\'e}thode, bas{\'e}e sur un sch{\'e}ma d'Euler, combine des r{\'e}solutions grossi{\`e}res et des r{\'e}solutions fines et ind{\'e}pendantes en temps en s'inspirant de ce qui est classique en espace. La parall{\'e}lisation qui en r{\'e}sulte se fait dans la direction temporelle ce qui est en revanche non classique. Elle a pour principale motivation les probl{\`e}mes en temps r{\'e}el, d'o{\`u} la terminologie propos{\'e}e de «parar{\'e}el ».
The purpose of this Note is to propose a time discretization of a partial differential evolution equation that allows for parallel implementations. The method, based on an Euler scheme, combines coarse resolutions and independent fine resolutions in time in the same spirit as standard spacial approximations. The resulting parallel implementation is done in the non standard time direction. Its main goal concerns real time problems, hence the proposed terminology of ``parareal'' algorithm.},
